### President's Message

>The Association of Canadian Mountain Guides (ACMG) has been the voice for all aspects of mountain guiding and instruction in Canada for over half a century. We set the professional standards for mountain guides, alpine guides, ski guides, rock guides, climbing instructors, hiking guides and via ferrata guides. We were the first guides outside of Europe to be recognized by the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations.
>
>Our members are recognized, and sought out as professionals in all aspects of protecting the public interest, and safety. This includes mountain travel, instructional work, commercial safety work, mountain rescue, and backcountry risk management.
>
>The diversity of our membership and certification streams makes us adaptable to the ever changing requirements of guiding in this country.
>
>Sylvia Forest, President

## History

In 1896 the first professional mountain guide worked in Canada. The first of the renowned "Swiss Guides" came to the Canadian Rockies in 1897. By 1899 the Canadian Pacific Railway decided that guides were essential for the safety and well-being of their guests and began the tradition of importing European guides to take guests into the Canadian mountains. These professional guides played a role in first ascents of many major peaks including Mt Sir Donald, Mt Sir Sanford, Mt Robson, Mt Louis, and Bugaboo Spire to name a few.

The Association of Canadian Mountain Guides was formed in 1963 with the encouragement of Parks Canada. By 1966, a program for training and certifying guides was in place. In 1972, the ACMG became the first non-European member of the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations (IFMGA), the international body that sets professional standards for mountain guides worldwide.

The ACMG now has over 1350 members and is growing at 5-10% per year. Canadian guides can be found working in various risk management capacities in many regions around the world. We are perhaps best known for having developed helicopter skiing and setting the acknowledged standard for safety and client care in ski guiding.

The ACMG is an incorporated not-for-profit society with an elected, volunteer Board. The association and its activities are funded solely through membership dues, partnership revenue and donations.
