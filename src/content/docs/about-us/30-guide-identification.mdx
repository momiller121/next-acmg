ACMG Members in good standing will be able to provide you with a link to their
digital ACMG Member ID card which inidicates that they are an active member. The ID card 
also indicates the one to many certificates that the member holds. 

Note that ACMG members who are fully certified IFMGA Mountain Guides may also 
carry a physical identification card from the International Federation
of Mountain Guides Association (IFMGA). The IFMGA is also known as the 
Union internationale des associations de guide de montagne (UIAGM) 
and Internationale Vereinigung der Bergführerverbände (IVBV) in Europe.

With the exception of the Mountain Guide certification, each other type of certificate
is associated with a defined and limited scope of practice to which the ACMG Member must adhere.
The [ACMG Scope of Practice](/documents/ACMG_SOP_04-2019.pdf) is generally available for review.

Only active ACMG Members in good standing are authorized to display one or more of
the ACMG insignia associated with their certifications.
