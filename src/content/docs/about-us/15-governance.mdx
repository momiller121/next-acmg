## Executive Director's Message

>The ACMG seeks to balance a dual mandate - protecting the public interest 
while also providing services to its members. Though on the surface these 
may appear to be duelling priorities, our primary focus is ensuring that 
our members are the best trained and most professional guides and instructors 
anywhere. This is the best way to ensure that the primary mandate, 
protection of the public, is fulfilled.
