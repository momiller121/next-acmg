If you are taking a course or being guided by an ACMG member, you will be requested 
to complete a liability waiver. This is a requirement set out by our insurance underwriter 
as well as by various land management authorities. Copies of the waiver are provided below 
so that you may familiarize yourself with some of the risks associated with the activity 
you are about to undertake. Please read it carefully.

## Advance Notice and Legal Advice

ACMG Guides (with a few exceptions) are not lawyers. The purpose of taking the time
to access and review these legal forms is for you to have the opportunity to 
review and address any questions you may have with your own trusted legal counsel.
We advise that legal questions be resolved  to your satisfaction prior to signing 
these documents and particiating in ACMG guided activities.

## Form Documents

The following Waivers and Acknowledgement of Risk Form documents are provided for your 
advanced knowledge of their contents.
